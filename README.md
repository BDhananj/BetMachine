# BetMachine
Implement program for a small slot machine which available in Casinos

"""we're actually going to build a text based slot machine.

Now, the way this will work is the user will deposit a certain amount of money. We're then going to allow them to bet on either one,two or three lines of the slot machine, just to keep it pretty simple. I know in real slot machines they have a lot more lines than that

and then we are going to determine if they want. So if they got any lines, we're going to multiply their bet by the value of the line,

add that to their balance, and then allow them to keep playing until they want to cash out or until they run out of money. So- this is actually a fairly complex project because we need to do a lot of things. We need to collect the users deposit, we need to add that to their balance.

We need to allow them to bet on a line or on multiple lines. We then need to see if they actually got any of those lines.

We then need to spin the slot machine or we would have done that before, right? We need to generate the different items that are going to be in the slot machine

on the different reels, and then we need to add whatever they won back to their balance. So there's quite a bit of stuff going on here

consider we have 3*3 slot machine
